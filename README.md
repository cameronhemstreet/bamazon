# bamazon
In this activity, I created an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

* To start the program simply type into the terminal of the app folder: node bamazonCustomer.js

* After launching the program, you will be shown a number of items, their item_id, department, price and stock. From here you will be prompted to purchase an item using the correct item_id followed by the quantity in the next prompt.

    * Fill out each prompt to your liking and continue, the app will show an updated version of the store including the updated quantities of items. **If you choose to purchase a higher quantity of an item than currently available you will be given a warning about insufficient quantity.

* If you would like to quit the program you can simply press q to exit.
